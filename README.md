## How to clone this repository

When we clone a Laravel repository some files are removed for security but, luckily for you I will show you how you can clone this project and be able to run it without any problem.

- The first thing we will have to do is to make a `git clone` of this repository in your htdocs folder (if you are using XAMPP).

- Launch `composer install` command inside the project, this will create the vendor folder with all the necessary dependencies for the project to work without any problem.

- Find the file `.env.example` inside the project to copy it and rename it as `.env`. In this file we will configure the database that you are going to use.

- Create the database in your database manager (in my case phpMyAdmin) with the name you have set in the .env file

- Now we launch the command `php artisan key:generate` and then the command `php artisan migrate`.

- Finally, we launch the Seeder I have created in my project, which are: TipeWashSeeder and UserSeeder.

    `php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder`

    `php artisan db:seed --class=TipeWashSeeder`

## API REST Feature

#Introduction
The API that I have developed is focused to generate a form consuming GET request that will bring us the types of washing that we currently have available and, in this way, make a request to register a new appointment in our database.
Once the request is received, our server will launch a response 'status' : 'error' (with the errors if any) or 'status' : 'success' if everything is correct with the fields ready to show the ticket to the customer. 
Let's go by parts:

The first thing you will want to do when consuming my API will be to fetch the data from the wash types, for this you will have to make a GET request with the following URL 'http://"domain"/api/appointments/create'. 
This will return the following json:

With this information we will be able to generate the form to make an appointment, all you need is the following:
- Field name="name" type="text".
- Field name="phone" type="text
- Field name="brand" type="text"
- Field name="model" type="text" Field name="model" type="text" Field name="model" type="text
- Field name="license_plate" type="text" Field name="license_plate" type="text" Field name="license_plate" type="text
- Field name="tipe_wash_id" type="select"
    o Inside this field is where it is recommended to place the types of washes obtained by the GET request.
- Field name="wheels" type="checkbox" value="15" o Field name="wheels" type="checkbox" value="15" o Field name="entry" type="entry
- Field name="entry" type="date" value="date" value="date
- Send button
The URL to which you will send this POST request generated by your form will be to http://"domain"/api/appointments/store
Once the data has been sent, as it is normal, there will be a response of if the operation has been successful or not, well.

In the case that it is successful:

On the other hand, if it is wrong, it will return the following (screenshot with all the wrong values):

If you need a more visual and practical support of how to use the API I have created a project with php and cURL where I use this same API REST. In this project you can visualize in a more practical way how to manage the errors that the API returns in case the request is wrong.
